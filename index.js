// variables are containers use to stay code
// type of variables.
//var, let, const, what is the difference between this variables
//let x = 5
//let y = 10
//let country = "nigeria"

//boolen is a data type that is asigned to data for a true or false.
//const names = " rosee 2786348iy83"// string
//const num =23 // integer
//const isMale = false //boolean

//console.log(names)
//console.log(num)
//console.log(isMale)

//let y = 10
//let x = 5
//console.log is a method eg Date.day( eg 

//const date = new Date() +1

//types of error in javascript
//let firstName = "john"
//let lastName = "peters"

//let full_name =firstName +" "+ lastName

//console.log(full_name)
//let a = 5 //asigning a value 5 to a 
//let b == 5 // b=5
//let c === 5

//const x = 5
//const y = 5

//if(x===y) { //if statement means that whatever you are looking for is true
    //return console.log("its Truthy") //if statement will only run this statement when the condition is true.
//}
//else{
    //return console.log("its false")
//}
//loops are structures that repeat a particlar kind of code untill instanceof
 //a condition is Meant


//a function in javascript design to perform a particular tasks. javascript function is excuted when something provokes instanceof. javscript is a block of code.

    //1. camel case
